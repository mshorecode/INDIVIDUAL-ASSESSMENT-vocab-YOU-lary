Here I am putting an overview of what my project is about.

## About the User <!-- This is a scaled down user persona -->
- The ideal user for this application is a student preparing for a test.
- The user can create, update and delete flashcards and assign a programming language to those flashcards.
- The user can sort through their flashcards based on language or search for a specific card. 
- The user can create and delete languages.

## Features <!-- List your app features using bullets! Do NOT use a paragraph. No one will read that! -->
- Upon creation card is rendered to the DOM under All Vocabulary.
- Cards can be sorted based on programming language.
- Cards can be sorted alphabetically, newest and oldest.
- Cards can be searched through with the search bar. 
- Update and delete functionality on each card.
- Creation of a language list is available.
